# 🚀 Personal Portfolio

This is my **personal portfolio website**, where I showcase some of the work that I do not include in my resume. I built this project to explore **modern front-end technologies**, improve my **deployment skills**, and experiment with **UI frameworks**.

## 🌟 Motivation

I created this portfolio for three main reasons:

1. **Showcase Unlisted Work** – Some of my projects don’t fit in a traditional resume, but I still wanted to share them publicly.
2. **Learn New Technologies** – This project helped me explore **Astro** and **Shadcn components**, as well as integrating **React** into an Astro project.
3. **Improve Front-End & Deployment Skills** – I used **Vercel** for hosting and experimented with different tools to improve my workflow.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Astro  
- **UI Components:** Shadcn (React-based)  
- **Hosting:** Vercel  
- **Mockup Tool:** Started with [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/)  

## 🎨 Development Process

I initially designed a **mockup** using **Bolt.new** and then iterated on the code, making updates and modifications. The process was straightforward and fun, and I enjoyed learning how to integrate **React inside Astro** to make use of Shadcn's UI components.
